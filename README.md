### Project Overview

This project is built using Stellar, a decentralized, public blockchain designed to provide developers with tools to create experiences that resemble cash transactions more closely than traditional cryptocurrencies. Stellar offers a faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient network compared to most blockchain-based systems, aiming to facilitate real-world, lasting impacts.

#### Features
This Stellar USDC-to-Naira project consists of two main sections:

1. **Account Management and Payments:** Learn how to create accounts, process payments, issue assets on the network, and build applications using the JavaScript SDK and Wallet SDK.

2. **Anchor Platform:** Explore a set of tools and APIs known as the Anchor Platform. This platform empowers developers and businesses to establish their own on and off-ramp services for the Stellar network. It includes standardized interfaces and implements several Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), simplifying integration with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges.

#### Implementation Details
While there's no backend implementation of Stellar in this project, it covers essential functionalities such as account creation, asset issuance, payment processing, and asset publishing. Assets representing real-world currencies like US dollars or Nigerian naira, as well as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether, are issued on the Stellar network.
